      "Try out for BYU's CCDC team on <span class='text-secondary font-bold'>September 27th, 2025</span> from <span class='text-accent font-bold'>9am to 5pm</span> in room W328 of the Tanner Building. Pizza and drinks will be provided. If this date does not work for you, reach out to Justin to arrange something else (<a class='underline text-accent' href='mailto:justin_giboney@byu.edu'>justin_giboney@byu.edu</a>).<br><br>\
      Tryouts will take the form of a cyber defense competition. In this competition, you will have access to four virtual machines (VMs): one Linux system, one Windows system, a Splunk indexer, and a firewall. You will be scored on how long you keep the services up on the Linux and Windows VMs. <br><br>\
      A week before the competition and in the middle of the competition you will also be given injects (or assignments) from the Chief Information Officer (CIO) asking you to perform a business task. Points will be split evenly between the defense competition and the injects."
